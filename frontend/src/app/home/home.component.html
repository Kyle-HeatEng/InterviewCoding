        We would like you to create us a search bar which updates on typing in an input giving the user the feeling of
        near instant access to the database. We use a document model database called MongoDB inconguction with our use
        of
        the mongoose library. All are JavaScript is written in Typescript with are serve running on the express
        framework
        and our client in Angular 15. A simplified web application has been build for you to add your modules to the
        code
        base. Good luck and don't forget the internet is your lifeline.
